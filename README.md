# Energy_management_for_IoT
The goal of this first lab is to understand the basics of Dynamic Power Management (DPM) using a simple Power State Machine (PSM) simulator in C. More specifically, we will evaluate in a case study how energy saving changes as a function of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The applied DPM policies (highlighting the pros and cons of each of them)
    \item The distribution of inactivity times
    \item The PSM parameters
\end{itemize}
